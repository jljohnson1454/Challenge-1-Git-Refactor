# Challenge-1-Git-Refactor


## Overview


HTML and CSS codes for Horiseon were provided so that I may refactor them to include accessibility options and ensure functionality as well as proper styling and structure. I added no design changes to the site, ensuring existing aesthetic styling remained intact. On the surface, I merely updated a go-to link on the page that had not been anchored properly. In the HTML file, I added semantic elements, a proper title for better SEO, and alt attributes to the images for accessibility. In the CSS, I consolidated duplicate selectors and additional ones in correlation to the ones in the HTML. With these updates, the HTML and CSS files are now more legible and streamlined per proper syntax etiquette.
